	<h2>Wikipedia Scraper Lab</h2>
	<p>Welcome! Here we will learn how to create the wikipedia scraper found on the <br>
	todays info section of this website. Starting this project, we have a couple of goals <br>
	in mind. We want to learn more about BeautifulSoup and Requests modules, which are used <br>
	in the webscraping process. We want to learn more behind the structure of html pages and <br>
	automatisation that can be done there. Any self respecing computer scientist does not look <br>
	to create more work where less work works just as well. We also want to to tie this to startup.</p> 
	<hr>
	<p> From above we can pull the following broad questions </p>
	<ul>
		<li> 1. How does web scraping work? </li>
		<li> 2. How can I make this as automated as possible </li>
		<li> 3. What tools and processes are involved </li>
		<li> 4. What steps can I take to efficiently make my script generic? </li>
	</ul>
	<p> As we continue, these broad questions will be brokenb down with each sub-question <br>
	labeled 1.a, 2.b, etc. <p>
	<hr>
	
	<p> Alright. Let us start with defining our overarching problem. </p> 
	<p>1.a What is web scraping? <br> 
	<p style="margin-left:20px">
		Web Scraping is the act of extracting data from a site and then using that data <br>
		is some way. Most commonly, this extraction is of plain html elements, such as prices <br>
		text, or list elements, however one can also extract metadata from pages.
	</p>
	
	<p> This leads us to our next question. We've defined web scraping, but this has left us with another <br>
	topic to define. This is a very common occurance in cs, when we peel back a layer of abstraction, we get more questions </p>
	
	<p>1.b What structure is involved in a web page?</p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px"> 
		Below is an snipit of the html for wikipedia's December 21 page. This is the juicy information. <br>
		html, along with javascript and css, form the basis for every website on the internet. html <br>
		provides the structure and content, css the layour and pretification, and javascript interactivity <br>
		and functionality. The easisiest way to look at html is to inspect element. We are going to focus <br>
		on the li tags, these are the lists of events per era. </p>

	<p> All of that is great, and a lot of information. If we are to do anything with this we must get it into our program <br>
	which, well, that's a good question. How does tsome program that lives on your computer and/or github get info from <br>
	a website that may be hosted on a server halfway across the world?
