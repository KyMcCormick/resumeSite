	<h2>Wikipedia Scraper Lab</h2>
	<p>Welcome! Here we will learn how to create the wikipedia scraper found on the <br>
	todays info section of this website. Starting this project, we have a couple of goals <br>
	in mind. We want to learn more about BeautifulSoup and Requests modules, which are used <br>
	in the webscraping process. We want to learn more behind the structure of html pages and <br>
	automatisation that can be done there. Any self respecing computer scientist does not look <br>
	to create more work where less work works just as well. We also want to to tie this to startup.</p> <br>
	<br>
	<p> From above we can pull the following broad questions </p>
	<ul>
		<li> 1. How does web scraping work? </li>
		<li> 2. How can I make this as automated as possible </li>
		<li> 3. What tools and processes are involved </li>
		<li> 4. What steps can I take to efficiently make my script generic? </li>
	</ul>
	<p> As we continue, these broad questions will be brokenb down with each sub-question <br>
	labeled 1.a, 2.b, etc. <p>
	<hr>
	
	<p> Alright. Let us start with defining our overarching problem. </p> <br>
	<p> What is web scraping? <br> <br>
	<p style="margin-right: 10px">
		Web Scraping is the act of extracting data from a site and then using that data <br>
		is some way. Most commonly, this extraction is of plain html elements, such as prices </br>
		text, or list elements, however one can also extract metadata from pages.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p> This leads us to our next question. We've defined web scraping, but this has left us with another <br>
	topic to define. This is a very common occurance in cs, when we peel back a layer of abstraction, we get more questions </p>
