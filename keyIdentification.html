	<h2>Key Identification Using Machine Learning</h2>
	<p>Since I started at Drexel, I have been interested in the overlap between music and computer science. At first <br>
	   I was interested in using AI generation, but I have since soured on that, then I was looking at the mathematical <br>
	   sides behind music and then it hit me. Lately, when playing bass and looking at the keys given for a specific <br>
	   song by sites like https://tunebat.com/ and https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/ I kept seeing that the keys given <br>
	   do not line up with what I hear or that the keys given are not consistent across versions. With that in mind </p>
	<hr>   
	<p> I started looking at key identification using Machine Learning and wanted to see if there was anyone who've <br>
	    done similar. Sadly, there's not much out there on anything lower than a very high academic level. Spotify <br>
	    likes to keep it's secrets ... here are the papers</p>
