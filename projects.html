	<p> <a href = "https://kymccormick.github.io/resumeSite/today.html" target = "_blank">Wikipedia Web Scraper Winter 2022</a></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Utilised web scraping and http requests to create an automated webpage</li>
		<li>Learned to use the Python BeautifulSoup and Requests Modules</li>
		<li>Automated the daily running and git management of the executables in a windows environment</li>
		<li>Created a cs 100 level tutorial following four essential questions in order to teach others</li>
	</ul>
	<p> <a href = "https://replit.com/@Cornix/adventureGame#main.py" target = "_blank">Trial and Tribulation: Adventure Game  Summer 2021</a></p>
        <ul>
                <li>Created a python text-based Adventure Game</li>
                <li>Following Object Oriented Paradigm, created <br>
                    a series of hour lessons for children ages 8-12</li>
                <li>Formulated algorithms for attack, movement, leaderboards, and shops </li>
                <li>Designed a 2d array and assorted methods to store and create a procedurally <br>
                    generated map, list of enemies, attacks, and loot</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p> This was a rather fun project. By engaging with the students, I learned how to communicate ideas <br>
	    much more concisely and adapt complex topics to simpler, easier to digest explanation. This <br>
	    experience helped me greatly in TAing. The game ended up being similar to some of the earliest <br>
	    online video games, such as dungeon and later games made by dnd fans to play over long distance <br>
	    In the process, I learned more about OOP development, data strucutre implementation and design <br>

	<p> <a href = "https://spotifygood.johnzlotek.xyz/" target = "_blank"> Spotipy Good: Winter-Spring 2021 </a></p>
        <ul>
                <li>Backend Developer in a team of four</li>
                <li>Created functions to search through Spotify's database as a dictionary</li>
                <li>Designed functions utilizing the Spotipy API to facilitate the recommendation process</li>
                <li>Formulated song recommendation criteria and calibrated based on test datasets</li>
                <li>Developed a python web hosted application using the Agile Development Process</li>
                <li>Utilized Django, GitHub, Spotipy API, and Website Bootstraps</li>
        </ul>
	<br>
	<p> This was the project I made for the freshmen design sequence at Drexel University. The project <br>
	    was based on the idea of another site that would roast your spotify account and jokingly insult <br>
	    you. Instead, my group developed a web app that would compliment your music taste, giving various <br>
	    metrics, like obscurity percentage, award winning songs or recods, and personal favorites, then <br>
	    provide recommendations that could be automatically added to the user's playlist
