	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<hr>
	 <p>Hello, I am a Computer Science student at Drexel University
        This website serves as a hub for my projects. These include a representation of my resume.
        I am very interested in the intersection of arts/music and computer science
        applying ML/AI to unique domains (not just chatgpt), systems programming, and computer 
	science education.I endeavor to become a professor after working in industry for a time</p>
        <hr>
	
	<h2> oSTEM </h2>
	<p> 
	I was the Event Coordinator for oSTEM. oSTEM is the national professional and collegiate organisation for queer people in stem.
	We work to provide professional development opportunities, solidarity, and community for
	LGBTQ+ workers in industry and academic settings. The Drexel chapter was started by Charlie
	Rose Stuart but folded due to the pandemic, with his help we have revitalised the organisation
	We have participated in Philly Code Fest, consulting with the CCI DEI Council, a
	professional headshots event with affirming workplace attire and makeup, serving as a guide
	for queer people in the workplace to feel comfortable with themselves.
	<br>
	</p>

	<h2> TAing </h2>
	<p>
	I have a great interest in computer science education and have become a TA at Drexel to further<br>
	this. TAing has been an eye opening experience, letting me learn how to communicate ideas, <br>	
	pedagogical technique, forming better relationships with professors, and reinforcing the concepts I learn.
	In this role, I also serve as a peer mentor for many younger students, some of which who've become TAs themself.
	<br><br>
	I have TAd for Introduction to CS and CS Principles, and Python I/II, but my main focus is the Freshman Design Sequence.
	As the Head TA for the Freshman Design Sequence, I work closely with the instructional team to refine pedegogical methods
	and refine the course. My changes, such as an increased emphasis on technical communication, clarified expectations, active learning,
	and TA training material and resources have had a noticeable impact through scores, student testimonials, and my 4-time nomination
	for the undergraduate TA award.
	</p>

	<h2> Music and Writing</h2>
	<p>
	I've played bass guitar for nine years, starting freshman year of high school, participating in my school's <br>
	marching, jazz, and concert bands. In marching band, we won 3 championships in my 4 years, with me as <br>
	section leader when our section posted the best score in school history. I compose in my free time, being <br>
	influenced from artists as diverse as Theolonius Monk, Vulfpeck, Stormzy, Arctic Monkeys, Velvet Underground <br>
	and The Grateful Dead, among others. <br>
	<br><br>
	I am also an avid writerl, particularly short works or poetry. I've written for about as long as I can remember and the oldest "poem"
	I can find with my name on it is from second grade. Needless to say, my work has improved much since then. The itch to write came from
	my father, a musician and lyricist who encouraged this behavoir from a young age. I hope to publish my work some day.
