	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<hr>
	 <p>Hello, I am a Computer Science student at Drexel University<br>
        This website serves as a hub for my projects. These include a representation of my resume.<br>
        I am very interested in the intersection of arts/music and computer science<br>
        applying ML/AI to unique domains (not just chatgpt), systems programming, and computer 
	science education. <br>
        I endeavor to become a professor after working in industry for a time</p>
        <hr>
	
	<h2> oSTEM </h2>
	<p> 
	I was the Event Coordinator for oSTEM. oSTEM is the national professional and collegiate organisation for queer people in stem. <br>
	We work to provide professional development opportunities, solidarity, and community for
	LGBTQ+ workers in industry and academic settings. The Drexel chapter was started by Charlie
	Rose Stuart but folded due to the pandemic, with his help we have revitalised the organisation
	We have participated in Philly Code Fest, consulting with the CCI DEI Council, a
	professional headshots event with affirming workplace attire and makeup, serving as a guide
	for queer people in the workplace to feel comfortable with themselves.
	<br>
	</p>

	<h2> TAing </h2>
	<p>
	I have a great interest in computer science education and have become a TA at Drexel to further<br>
	this. TAing has been an eye opening experience, letting me learn how to communicate ideas, <br>	
	pedagogical technique, forming better relationships with professors, and reinforcing the concepts I learn.
	In this role, I also serve as a peer mentor for many younger students, some of which who've become TAs themself.
	<br>
	I have TAd for Introduction to CS, the freshmen design sequence, and Intro ton.

	<br>
	I have TAd for Introduction to CS, the freshmen design sequence, Intro to Python I/II, and Computer Science
	Principles. I was nominated for the Undergraduate TA Excelence award in  my very first year and feedback I gave
	and materials I made are now integrated into multiple of these courses.

	<h2> Music </h2>
	<p>
	I've played bass guitar for six years, starting freshman year of high school, participating in my school's <br>
	marching, jazz, and concert bands. In marching band, we won 3 championships in my 4 years, with me as <br>
	section leader when our section posted the best score in school history. I compose in my free time, being <br>
	influenced from artists as diverse as Theolonius Monk, Vulfpeck, Stormzy, Arctic Monkeys, Velvet Underground <br>
	and The Grateful Dead, among others. <br>
